Please scroll down the page to see a lot of useful information about how everything works in the project, and a comprehensive list of project features as well.

## How to Install and Get Started

1. **Essential Tools**: Ensure that [_VSCode_](https://code.visualstudio.com), [_Git_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/develop/git/install-and-set-up-git), _GitHub Desktop_ ([Windows/macOS](https://desktop.github.com) | [Linux](https://dev.to/rahedmir/is-github-desktop-available-for-gnu-linux-4a69)), and _Node.js LTS_ ([Windows/macOS](https://nodejs.org) | [Linux](https://youtu.be/NS3aTgKztis)) are installed.
2. **Project Cloning**: [_Create a new fork_](https://github.com/blefnk/relivator/fork) and use GitHub Desktop to download it.
3. **Configuration**: Open VSCode and load the project folder. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and search for `>Create New Terminal`. Install _PNPM_ using `corepack enable`. Then, enter `pnpm install` to install the packages. Next, copy the `.env.example` file to a new `.env` file and fill in at least the `NEXT_PUBLIC_DB_PROVIDER` and `DATABASE_URL` fields. Finally, send the database schema to your database using `pnpm mysql:push` or `pnpm pg:push`.
4. **Run, Stop, Build**: Use `pnpm dev` to run the app (visit <http://localhost:3000> to check it). Stop it by focusing on the console and pressing `Ctrl+C`. After making changes, build the app using `pnpm build`. _Thats okay if you see Clerk's warnings_ when executing `pnpm build`, this is a known issue not related to Relivator.
5. **Commit and Deploy**: Upload your project to your GitHub profile using GitHub Desktop. Then, deploy it by importing the project into [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new), making your website publicly accessible on the internet. If you wish to share your work, seek feedback, or ask for assistance, you're welcome to do so either [in our Discord server](https://discord.gg/Pb8uKbwpsJ) or [via GitHub discussions](https://github.com/blefnk/relivator/discussions).

Tip! You can create a folder, for instance, `home`, within the `src` directory, to store your project-specific files. It allows you for easy updates whenever Relivator has new versions.

  <summary>[27.12.2023] üéÑ Relivator v1.2.0 is here! ü•≥ Click to see the announcement üéÅ</summary>

---

_Relivator 1.2.0 is already here! I, [@blefnk Nazarii Korniienko](https://github.com/blefnk), am thrilled to wrap up this year 2023, proudly presenting this release to the OSS community! So, the result of over two months of hard work is finally here!_

In this version, significant attention was focused on stability, security, performance optimization, and a substantial improvements in design‚Äîboth visually, UX, and the logic of how the app works. A lot was really done, too much to list everything! Be sure to install it and check it out for yourself!

By the way, you can now enjoy a finely-tuned ESLint Flat Config! Also, it's worth noting that Clerk, since version 1.1.0, is no longer considered deprecated in the Relivator project. Thanks to 1.2.0, Clerk now works seamlessly with an easy switch to NextAuth.js when needed, all on the fly. Plus, full support for Turbopack (next dev --turbo) is finally here, even for next-intl!

As for next-intl, finally, we can now enjoy internationalization that works not only on the client-side but also on the server! Only the 404 page has client-side i18n messages, all other pages and components use i18n as server-first. And this is really cool!

Many unique solutions have been implemented in this new version. Moreover, using Relivator from this version, you have the opportunity to try out the alpha version of our unique Code-First/No-Code Builder system for React pages and components (which will appear in Reliverse CMS in the future). Just visit the Admin page while in the development environment and enjoy.

If you have already used Relivator before, please pay attention, this is very important! Be sure to check the updated .env.example file and update your .env file accordingly.

As a small teaser/spoiler, for Relivator 1.3.0, even more improvements in visual design and UX are planned; 1.4.0 will come with a magical CLI implementation, allowing you to quickly obtain only the necessary features and dependencies for your app (even automated updates and the ability to add other functions and packages to an already installed app); 1.5.0 will undergo a full code refactoring that will meet all the best standards and practices; 1.6.0-2.0.0+ versions, apart from many other things, will receive most of the items currently unchecked in the Roadmap (located in the project's README.md). It's going to be incredible!

So, install this new version of Relivator 1.2.0 and appreciate the multitude of incredible features, and freely use it in your own projects today. Please use your preferred feedback channels to share your thoughts on Relivator 1.2.0 and what you would like to see in future releases.

Don't forget to also check out the significantly updated README.md, it's worth it.

Enjoy! ‚ùÑÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è Merry Christmas and Happy New Year 2024! üéáü•≥

Ensure ultimate type-safety using strict mode in [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) including ["Do's and Don'ts"](https://typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/do-s-and-don-ts.html) recommendations (without using [dangerous type assertions](https://youtube.com/watch?v=K9pMxqb5IAk), and with [optional types correct usage](https://youtube.com/watch?v=qy6IBZggXSQ), by also using `pnpm fix:ts` ‚Äî once you run that, [TypeStat](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/TypeStat) will start auto-fixing TS typings); And also ensure type-safety with typedRoutes, zod, middleware, etc.
- [ ] 69. Ensure the project lacks any unused items, such as packages, libraries, and variables. Also, make sure the project's code adheres to the [Never Nester principles](https://youtube.com/watch?v=CFRhGnuXG-4). Because, as Linus Torvalds once said, _If you need more than 3 levels of indentation, you're screwed anyway, and should fix your program_.
- [ ] 70. Ensure project has full support for [GSAP](https://gsap.com) (GreenSock Animation Platform) library, with convient ways to use @gsap/react [useGSAP() hook](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/React/tools/useGSAP).
- [ ] 71. Ensure full Next.js Edge support and compatibility.
- [ ] 72. Ensure full [Biome](https://biomejs.dev), [Bun](https://bun.sh), and [Docker](https://docker.com) support and compatibility.
- [ ] 73. Ensure all website languages are grammatically correct and adhere to the latest rules for each language.
- [ ] 74. Ensure all items in the project are sorted in ascending order unless different sorting is required elsewhere.
- [ ] 75. Ensure the project avoids using redundant imports, such as importing everything from React, when it's sufficient to import only the necessary hooks, for example.
- [ ] 76. Ensure accessibility for **users**, **developers** (both beginners and experts), **bots** (like [Googlebot](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/googlebot) or [PageSpeed Insights Crawler](https://pagespeed.web.dev)), for **everyone**.
- [ ] 77. Enhance `middleware.ts` configuration with multi-middleware implementation.
- [ ] 78. Employ all relevant [TanStack](https://tanstack.com) libraries.
- [ ] 79. Eliminate each disabling in the `.eslintrc.cjs` file, configure config to strict, but to be still beginner-friendly.
- [ ] 80. Elegantly configure `app.ts`, offering a single config to replace all possible others.
- [ ] 81. Develop workflows for both sellers and customers.
- [ ] 82. Develop an even more sophisticated implementation of user subscriptions and the checkout system via Stripe; and also write Jest/Ava tests for Stripe and use `.thing/hooks/stripe_*.json` [webhookthing](https://docs.webhookthing.com) data files for these tests.
- [ ] 83. Develop an advanced storefront featuring products, categories, and subcategories.
- [ ] 84. Develop an advanced 404 Not Found page with full internationalization support.
- [ ] 85. Develop advanced sign-up, sign-in, and restoration using email-password and magic links.
- [ ] 86. Decrease file count by merging similar items, etc.
- [ ] 87. Create the most beginner-friendly and aesthetically pleasing starter possible.
- [ ] 88. Create an advanced notification system, inclusive of toasters, pop-ups, and pages.
- [ ] 89. Create a new landing page with a distinctive design and update components, plus fully redesign all other pages and components.
- [ ] 90. Consider adding Facebook's [StyleX](https://stylexjs.com/blog/introducing-stylex). However, StyleX currently requires setting up Babel/Webpack in the project, which we avoid to maintain full Turbopack support. As a suitable alternative, consider jjenzz's [Tokenami](https://github.com/tokenami/tokenami#readme) or Chakra's [Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com). Possibly, we can make a choice between them all while bootstrapping the project with Reliverse CLI. These libraries help with avoiding the deprecated [initial idea](https://stylexjs.com/blog/introducing-stylex/#the-origins-of-stylex) for [CSS-in-JS](https://medium.com/dailyjs/what-is-actually-css-in-js-f2f529a2757). Learn more [here](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/110) and in [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-in-js).
- [ ] 91. Confirm the project is free from duplicates, like files, components, etc.
- [ ] 92. Conduct useful tests, including possible stress tests, to simulate and assess app performance under high-traffic conditions.
- [ ] 93. Comprehensively configure Next.js 14 App Router, with API routes managed by Route Handlers, including the RSCs and all other new features.
- [ ] 94. Complete the BA11YC (Bleverse Accessibility Convention) checklist; which may relay on the following principle in the future: [DesignPrototype](https://uiprep.com/blog/ultimate-guide-to-prototyping-in-figma)-[CodePrototype](https://medium.com/@joomiguelcunha/the-power-of-prototyping-code-55f4ed485a30)-CodeTests-HqDesign-[TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)-HqCode-[CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD).
- [ ] 95. Complete parts of the [BA11YC (Bleverse Accessibility Convention) checklist](https://github.com/bs-oss/BA11YC). This includes using software [Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/what-is-pattern) for code refactoring.
- [ ] 96. Check all components with side-effects for re-rendering, it is recommended to re-render each component a maximum of 2 times ([good video about it (in Ukrainian)](https://youtu.be/uH9uMH2e5Ts)).
- [ ] 97. Boost app performance scores on platforms like Google PageSpeed Insights. Ensure the app passes all rigorous tests.
- [ ] 98. Apply the [next-usequerystate](https://github.com/47ng/next-usequerystate) library where appropriate ([read the article](https://francoisbest.com/posts/2023/storing-react-state-in-the-url-with-nextjs)).
- [ ] 99. All third-party libraries and React components should be appropriately isolated. This includes verifying data from these libraries, such as Clerk, and wrapping the components with the "use client" directive as necessary.
- [ ] 100. Add a reviews section to the landing page. Obtain feedback on Relivator from five widely recognized individuals on the web.
- [ ] 101. Add an admin dashboard that includes stores, products, orders, subscriptions, and payments.
- [ ] 102. Add global color variables to all places where they are applied, instead of having hardcoded colors.
- [ ] 103. Add pop-ups for cookies/GDPR notifications (with a respective management settings page), and Google floating notifications for quick login, etc.
- [ ] 104. Add some interesting and useful types to the project, for example, using the [type-fest](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest) library.
- [ ] 105. Add the integration of a smart git-hooks system with various additional useful functionality.
- [ ] 106. Add the most valuable and useful ESLint things from [awesome-eslint](https://github.com/dustinspecker/awesome-eslint) collection.

## Project Commands

- **`pnpm db:studio`**: This command runs the Drizzle Studio on the <https://local.drizzle.studio> path.
- **`pnpm stripe:listen`**: This command runs the Stripe webhook listener and assists in setting up Stripe environment variables. You may need to have the [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) installed to run this command.
- **`pnpm latest`**: This command updates all project packages to their latest stable versions and updates tRPC to the most recent version on the next branch. This ensures we have the newest versions of TanStack Query v5.
- **`pnpm up-next:canary`**: This command updates Next.js and React to the latest versions available on their canary branches. Use this only if you are certain about its necessity.
- **`pnpm appts`**: This command performs a comprehensive check of the codebase. It sequentially executes `pnpm typecheck` to identify any TypeScript errors, `pnpm format` to format the code with Prettier (and/or with Biome ‚Äî coming soon), `pnpm lint` for code linting with EsLint (most of rules in `eslint.config.ts` are disabled by default, just enable what you need) (and/or with Biome ‚Äî coming soon). **NOTE**: Linting can be time-consuming, so please be patient. The command also runs `pnpm test` to check Jest tests, and finally, it executes `pnpm build`. _Thats okay if you see Clerk's warnings_ when executing `pnpm build`, this is a known issue not related to Relivator.

The `DATABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_DB_PROVIDER`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_PROVIDER` environment variables are mandatory; others are optional. You're welcome to deploy the application as-is, but ensure you verify what's necessary. Though the application will run without certain variables, missing ones may deactivate specific features.

Ensure that default values are defined for essential environment variables. Never store secrets in the `.env.example` file. For newcomers or repo cloners, use `.env.example` as a template to create your `.env` file, ensuring it‚Äôs never committed. Update the schema in `/src/env.mjs` when adding new variables.

Further [information about environment variables is available here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables).

_A cleaner and improved version of this section is coming soon. Keep an eye out!_

In the 1.1.0 Relivator release, the `.env.example` file was greatly simplified and will be streamlined even further in upcoming versions. We aim to ensure that unspecified values will simply deactivate related functionality without halting app compilation.

## Stripe Payments

Refer to the [`.env.example`](https://github.com/blefnk/relivator/blob/main/.env.example) file as your guide where and how to get all the important environment variable keys for Stripe, including webhooks both for localhost and deployment.

Locally, install the [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) and run the command `pnpm stripe:listen` to initiate the Stripe webhook listener. This action connects Stripe to your account and generates a webhook key, which you can then set as an environment variable in Stripe's settings.

When testing Stripe, you can use its test data: `4242424242424242` | `12/34` | `567` | `Random Name` | `Random Country`.

Please refer to [src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts](https://github.com/blefnk/relivator/blob/main/src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts) file to learn more in the deep details how Stripe things work in the app. You can also visit the [official Stripe repository](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node#readme), where you'll find a lot of useful information.

## Database Support

Relivator is designed to effortlessly support both `MySQL` and `PostgreSQL` databases. Although it comes with MySQL and [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com) configured as the default database provider, switching to PostgreSQL provided by [Neon](https://neon.tech)/[Vercel](https://vercel.com/storage/postgres)/[Railway](https://railway.app) ‚Äî is really simple as pie. To do so, just update the `NEXT_PUBLIC_DB_PROVIDER` key in your `.env` file to `neon`/`vercel`/`railway` accordingly. While Relivator is optimized for these providers, any others compatible with Drizzle and NextAuth.js might also work, though they may require some additional setup.

To initiate a new database or propagate schema changes, execute the `pnpm mysql:push` or `pnpm pg:push` command. This ensures that all drafts made to the schema files‚Äîfound under `src/data/db/*`‚Äîare mirrored in your selected database provider.

For database migrations, utilize the `mysql:generate`/`pg:generate`, review the `drizzle` folder to ensure everything correct (execute `db:drop` if not), and run the `pnpm:migrate` command when you are ready.

Ensure you do not manually delete files from the `drizzle` directory. If a migration needs to be reversed, employ the [`pnpm db:drop` command](https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/commands#drop-migration) to manage this in a controlled way.

In the release of Relivator v1.1.0, we made our best efforts to provide simultaneous support for both MySQL and PostgreSQL for the Drizzle ORM. In future releases, we aim to integrate Prisma ORM to this project as well. Thanks to it, the project will be even more inclusive to everyone.

By default we ensure that every database system has everything the same by using `NEXT_PUBLIC_DB_PROVIDER` env variable and by exporting things in the `src/data/db/index.ts` file. When you decide which database provider is best suit your needs, you can safely comment out or remove unneeded providers in the `switch-case` of this file, then related schema files can be removed as well; note that some small additional work may be also required.

### Additional Notes About Stripe

The Stripe webhook API route does not need to be invoked explicitly within your application, such as after a user selects a subscription plan or makes a purchase. Webhooks operate independently of user actions on the frontend and serve as a means for Stripe to relay events directly to your server.

When an event occurs on Stripe's end, such as a successful payment, Stripe generates an event object. This object is then automatically sent to the endpoint you've specified, either in your Stripe Dashboard or, for testing purposes, in your `package.json` via the Stripe CLI. Finally, your server's API route receives the event and processes it accordingly.

For example, when a user selects a subscription plan, you would typically first use Stripe's API to create either a `Payment Intent` or `Setup Intent` object. This action can be executed either on the client-side or the server-side. The frontend then confirms the payment using Stripe.js, thereby completing the payment or subscription setup process.

Your webhook is automatically triggered based on these events. There's no need to manually "call" the webhook route; Stripe manages this for you according to your settings in the Stripe Dashboard or in your `package.json` for local testing.

After deploying your app, don't forget to specify the webhook URL in your Stripe Dashboard. Navigate to the Webhooks section and enter the following URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`.

In summary, there's no need to specify the path to your Stripe API route where the user selects a subscription plan. The webhook mechanism operates independently and is triggered automatically by Stripe.

## Internationalization

_Stay tuned for further expansions to this section in the future._

Multilingualism at Bleverse is revered. We adore discussing it and plan to delve into the topic of Next.js 14 App Router internationalization in future writings.

Presently, all languages are machine-translated. Future revisions by native speakers are planned. Note that i18n messages from another one of our open-source projects are currently present and will be removed shortly.

_Currently not available._ Use `pnpm lint:i18n` to verify your i18n files. The tool attempts to rectify issues when possible, offering features like ascending sort. No output means everything is in order.

We are using _next-intl_ for internationalization. Sometime we can use beta/rc versions as needed. Find more information about it [here](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/blog/next-intl-3-0) and [here](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl/pull/149).

### How to add a new language

_The process described below will be simplified and automated in the future. Please let us know if you have any further questions regarding the current process for adding languages._

1. We will need an [i18n code](https://saimana.com/list-of-country-locale-code/) (in the format `language-country`; the language code alone is sufficient, but it's not optimal for SEO). For example, let's take Chinese, for which I know the codes _zh-cn/zh-tw/zh-hk_ are used.
2. Open the `src/data/i18n` folder and create a `zh-cn.json` file with the example content: `{ "landing": { "heading": "Âª∫Á´ãÊõ¥È´òÊïà„ÄÅÊõ¥Âê∏Âºï‰∫∫‰∏îÊõ¥ÊúâÂà©ÂèØÂõæÁöÑÂú®Á∫øÂïÜÂ∫óÔºö‰ΩøÁî® Relivator" } }`.
3. Now open `src/i18n.ts` and add `"zh-cn": zh_cn` with the appropriate `import` at the top.
4. In the file `src/navigation.ts`, add the corresponding values to `locales` and `labels`.
5. Run `pnpm dev` and review the landing page header. If it appears correctly, you're ready to go.
6. Optionally, I recommend using the VSCode extension [i18n Ally](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Lokalise.i18n-ally), which makes machine translation easy.
7. Also optionally, install [specific CSpell language](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell-dicts#language-dictionaries) for full support of this language in VSCode (when using the "[Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)" extension). If your language is not available, try to find a word dictionary file on the web or make one yourself (see CSpell docs).

By the way, **if the country flag is not displayed**: open `src/localization-main.tsx`, go to _LocaleFlagIcon_ and add your `else if`. Please visit the [flag-icons library website](https://flagicons.lipis.dev/) to see the code for the missing icon. The example for _zh-cn_ will be: `} else if (baseLocale === "zh") { return <span aria-hidden="true" className="fi fi-cn mr-2" />; }`

Please be aware that both the "i18n Ally" VSCode extension and manual systems like "Google Translate" may incorrectly translate variables. If you encounter an error like this:
Original Message: 'The intl string context variable "Á±ªÂà´" was not provided to the string "Ë¥≠‰π∞ÊúÄÂ•ΩÁöÑ{Á±ªÂà´}"'.
This error occurs because we have {Á±ªÂà´}, but it should be {category}. To verify the correct variable, refer to the en-us.json file.Certainly! Here's a grammatically corrected version of your text:

Please be aware that both the "i18n Ally" VSCode extension and manual systems like "Google Translate" may incorrectly translate variables. If you encounter an error like this:
Original Message: 'The intl string context variable "Á±ªÂà´" was not provided to the string "Ë¥≠‰π∞ÊúÄÂ•ΩÁöÑ{Á±ªÂà´}"'.
This error occurs because we have {Á±ªÂà´}, but it should be {category}. To verify the correct variable, refer to the en-us.json file.
So the correct version for this specific case will be:

```txt
"categories": {
  "buyProducts": "Ë¥≠‰π∞ ${category} Á±ªÂà´ÁöÑ‰∫ßÂìÅ",
  "buyFromCategories": "‰ªéÊúÄÂ•ΩÁöÑÂïÜÂ∫óË¥≠‰π∞ {category}",
  "buyTheBest": "Ë¥≠‰π∞ÊúÄÂ•ΩÁöÑ {category}"
},
```

**Currently supported locales (you can add your own manually):**

de-DE, en-US, es-ES, fa-IR, fr-FR, hi-IN, it-IT, pl-PL, tr-TR, uk-UA.

## Principles, Design Decisions, Code Insights, Recommendations

_We're continuously improving this section. Contributions are welcomed!_

Our starter aims to be a rich resource for developers at all stages of their journey. Within the comment blocks and dedicated sections at the end of select files, you'll find valuable insights and clarifications on a wide array of topics. Your contributions to enhancing these educational nuggets are highly encouraged!

**Principles (W.I.P):**

- [ ] Every file and component should be built consciously, by using [KISS/DRY/SOLID/YAGNI principles](https://blog.openreplay.com/applying-design-principles-in-react), with a certain sense of intelligence, with performance in mind.
- [ ] We need to think of the project as if it were a planet with its own continents, countries, cities, rooms, individuals, entities etc.

<details>
  <summary>Why "TypeScript Essential Plugins" is Recommended</summary>

¬´Feature-complete TypeScript plugin that improves every single builtin feature such as completions, definitions, references and so on, and also adds even new TypeScript killer features, so you can work with large codebases faster! We make completions more informative. Definitions, references (and sometimes even completions) less noisy. And finally our main goal is to provide most customizable TypeScript experience for IDE features.¬ª ¬© [VSCode Extension Repository](https://github.com/zardoy/typescript-vscode-plugins#readme)

Note: You can configure extension settings by opening VSCode Settings UI and searching for `@ext:zardoy.ts-essential-plugins` there.

</details>

**Advanced Environment Variables:**

The `.env.example` file covers all the essential variables for a fully functional website, tailored for beginners. However, if you require advanced configurations, you can modify any value in `.env` file as needed.

**About the Plugins Folder:**

This folder contains optional plugins for Relivator. Developed by @blefnk and other contributors, these plugins extend functionality and provide additional features. If you find that certain plugins are not beneficial for your project, feel free to remove their corresponding folders.

**Function Over Const for Components:**

We advocate the use of the `function` keyword instead of `const` when defining React components. Using `function` often improves stack traces, making debugging easier. Additionally, it makes code semantics more explicit, thereby making it easier for other developers to understand your intentions.

**Personal Recommendations:**

We advise regularly clearing your browser cache and deleting the `.next` folder to ensure optimal performance and functionality.

Currently, we don‚Äôt utilize Contentlayer due to its instability with Windows. Therefore, we're exploring options for its usage in the `.env` configuration file. Future plans might involve developing our own solution for content writing. Integration with external providers, such as Sanity, may also be a future feature, with corresponding enable/disable options.

**Project Configuration:**

The `src/app.ts` file hosts critical configurations to modify website contents and settings, enabling you to:

- Control the content presented on the website.
- Adjust various settings, such as deactivating the theme toggle.
- Manage generic site-wide information.

Customize this file as per your requirements.

**Authentication:**

Setting up authentication is straightforward.

You can configure available sign-in providers for Clerk in the `src/app.ts` file.

Please remember that Clerk fully works with third-party services like "Google PageSpeed Insight" only when domain and live keys are used.

_This section will be implemented soon._

**How to Deploy the Project:**

Please check the _How to Install and Get Started_ section before making the initial deployment.

Consult the deployment guides for [Vercel](https://create.t3.gg/en/deployment/vercel), [Netlify](https://create.t3.gg/en/deployment/netlify), and [Docker](https://create.t3.gg/en/deployment/docker) for further details. The project has only been tested on Vercel; please inform us if you encounter issues with other deployment services.

**Styling, Design System, UI Components:**

TODO: Implement design system and style guide.

By default, this project includes components from various libraries, as well as unstyled [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) components. Shadcn/ui even allows you to generate new UI components using its CLI (where "button" can be any Shadcn UI element): `pnpm dlx shadcn-ui@latest add button`.

W.I.P. ‚Äî Use `pnpm css` to watch for [CSS tokens](https://blog.devgenius.io/link-figma-and-react-using-figma-tokens-89e6cc874b4d) in accordance with the project's design system. [Tokenami](https://github.com/tokenami/tokenami#readme) and Figma are anticipated to be utilized for this concept. For additional information, refer to points #33 and #90 in the Relivator's Roadmap.

**Bun Things Compatibility:**

`Relivator` can already harness some fantastic **[`Bun`](https://bun.sh)** features. For this starter, we currently recommend using `pnpm`. Full Bun support and compatibility will be shipped as soon as Windows binaries are available. _Section expansion coming soon._

**Typical App Workflow (Coming Soon):**

A comprehensive guide detailing the typical application workflow will be implemented soon. For now, here's a quick overview:

1. _Run Development Server_: `pnpm dev`
2. _Environment Configuration_: `.env`
3. _Middleware Setup_: `middleware.ts`
4. _Additional Steps_: Stay tuned...

**FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions):**

_Q:_ How to grant admin rights to myself or to another user?
_A:_ Just run `pnpm db:studio`, navigate to the `acme_user` table and set `role: admin` for the user you need. In the future, if you have admin rights, you will be able to change the user privilegies of selected users directly from the frontend admin page.

_Q:_ What does the `DEV_DEMO_NOTES` environment variable mean?
_A:_ Just don't use it. It is used only on the official [Relivator demo website](https://relivator.bleverse.com) to showcase certain features that are not needed in real-world applications.

_Q:_ I'm using PlanetScale as my database provider. After taking a break from the project, I'm now encountering "unable to connect to branch" error in the console. How can I fix this?
_A:_ Simply go to the PlanetScale dashboard and click on the `wake up` button. Please contact us in case if your database is not asleep and the problem still persists.

## Migration from Other Starters to Relivator

If you've been exploring which Next.js starter to select for your next project like [create-next-app](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-boilerplate), [create-t3-app](https://create.t3.gg), [Next.js Commerce (Vercel Store)](https://vercel.store), [Skateshop](https://github.com/sadmann7/skateshop), [OneStopShop](https://github.com/jackblatch/OneStopShop), [Taxonomy](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/taxonomy)/[nextflix](https://github.com/Apestein/nextflix), [payload](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload), [Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa), or [any other projects](https://github.com/blefnk/relivator/wiki/Project-Credits-&-Contributors) ‚Äì your search can end here.

_¬´There are a lot of impractical things about owning a ~~Porsche~~ Relivator. But they're all offset by the driving experience. It really is unique. ~~Lamborghinis~~ Skateshop and ~~Ferraris~~ Vercel Store come close. And they are more powerful in specific cases, but they don't handle like a ~~Porsche~~ Relivator.¬ª ¬© Kevin O'Leary_

All these projects are incredible, and if minimalism appeals to you, we recommend checking them out. The creators behind these projects are extremely talented individuals, and we offer them our endless thanks. Without them, this starter would not exist.

However, **if you want a POWERHOUSE**‚ÄîRelivator suitable for every scenario‚Äîthen **Relivator is definitely the starter you need** to fork it right now! Relivator incorporates numerous features from all those projects and strives to push the limits of Next.js and React capabilities. With Relivator, your opportunities are boundless.

If you **choose Relivator to be your next project starter** and you want to migrate from the projects above to Relivator, then please give us a few days. We will use the project wiki to write there guide how to do this. In this guide you will learn how to migrate your project to our project. Migration guide will be available for both "app" and "pages" directories.
