## Developer Onboarding

_Last updated: August 4, 2024_

Welcome to Relivator 1.2.6, a project created by @blefnk Nazar Kornienko.

üöÄ Yay! Congrats on the installation! If you like it, please [give us a star](https://github.com/blefnk/relivator-nextjs-template) on GitHub! üôè

This text comes from a component in the special folder called `cluster`. **This text can only be seen in development mode.** You can read about this folder at the end of this onboarding tutorial. Thank you for installing Relivator!

RECOMMENDED STEPS

Click on everything you see in the app to learn how it works.

Go to <a href={`${config.framework.repo}#readme`}>{config.framework.name}'s README.md</a>; and read the latest documentation.

Read the `The Cluster Folder` section below. Create the own component.

Join the project's <a href="https://discord.gg/Pb8uKbwpsJ">Discord server</a>. Star Relivator's <a href={config.framework.repo}>GitHub repo</a>.

Contribute to the project or <a href={`${config.framework.repo}/issues`}>create a new issue</a>, and grab some gifts.

THE CLUSTER FOLDER

The `cluster` folder is for the own components and files that you can store in it, ensuring they will not be overwritten when new Relivator updates are released.

You can also use the `cluster` folder to override the default components and files that come with Relivator. This is useful if you want to make changes to the default components and files provided by Relivator.

For example, if you want to override the default `app.ts` file, you can place an `app.ts` file in the cluster folder. The `app.ts` file in the cluster folder will override the default `app.ts` file that comes with Relivator.

The same applies to any other component or file that you want to override. **Make sure to replace the paths in the original files** with the paths to the cluster folder when overriding the original components and files.

Additionally, you can easily migrate to Relivator by placing specific parts or the entire current React project in this folder and then incrementally adopting it to work with Relivator.
