# This script provides a framework, but the crucial part, analyze_typescript_file, where we parse and extract the type information from TypeScript files, is not implemented. This requires a more sophisticated approach, possibly using a TypeScript parser or AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) analyzer in Python. The possible library for this is typescript-estree, which we can use via a Node.js script and then integrate its output into our Python script.
# Also, the information we might want to extract about each type could include:
# Type name | File where it's defined | Line number | Properties of the type (if it's an object)
# Extends or implements other types (inheritance/interfaces) | Usage count across the project

# TODO: Implement the logic to analyze the typescript file
# and extract type information
