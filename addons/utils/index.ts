// ðŸ’¡ Never keep code in the utils folder that can only run on the server. Otherwise, you will encounter anomalies during the project build. For example, an error like `node:` and `file:` not found, or the package `fs`, `crypto`, etc. not found. Read more about this in the RQ18 of the README.md file. Want to see the error for yourself? Move the file `src/server/api/uploadthing/react.ts` to `src/utils`, import it in this file, run `pnpm build`, get scared, remove the import, and move the file back to its place.
