          RQ29: Should I modify the components by
          [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) (as of Relivator 1.2.6, they are
          located in the "addons/components/ui" folder)? RA29: You may lose your
          changes if @shadcn or
          [Reliverse](https://github.com/orgs/reliverse/repositories) update any
          of these components in the release of Relivator 1.3.x+. Therefore, the
          best option currently is to use, for example, the
          "addons/cluster/reliverse/shadcn/ui" folder, where you can have files
          that you can safely overwrite the original files with, ensuring you do
          not lose your changes. As an example, this folder already contains a
          `cluster-readme.tsx` file, which only re-exports the original
          `button.tsx` file. So, you can create a `button.tsx` file here and
          copy and paste that line into your newly created file. Alternatively,
          you can duplicate the code from the original file and make any
          modifications you want. Use `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+H` and simply replace
          `addons/components/ui` with `addons/cluster/reliverse/shadcn/ui` (the
          difference is only in the words "browser" and "cluster").
          `addons/cluster` is your house; feel free to do anything you want
          here, mess it up or tidy it up as you wish. This is your own house,
          and no one has the right to take it away from you.
