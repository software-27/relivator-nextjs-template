// !! export { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

// Try not to modify the original shadcn components manually (only @reliverse/addons-relimter codemods scripts are allowed to modify them). If you want to change shadcn components, for example, the `Button`, then do it in this file. This way, you can safely make changes without losing your work when updates are released in the future. If you don't want to change anything about the Button, just leave this re-export as it is.
// ?| README.md:
// RQ29: Should I modify the components by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) (as of Relivator 1.2.6, they are located in the "addons/components/ui" folder)?
// RA29: You may lose your changes if @shadcn or [Reliverse](https://github.com/orgs/reliverse/repositories) update any of these components in the release of Relivator 1.3.x+. Therefore, the best option currently is to use, for example, the "addons/cluster/reliverse/shadcn/ui" folder, where you can have files that you can safely overwrite the original files with, ensuring you do not lose your changes. As an example, this folder already contains a `cluster-readme.tsx` file, which only re-exports the original `button.tsx` file. So, you can create a `button.tsx` file here and copy and paste that line into your newly created file. Alternatively, you can duplicate the code from the original file and make any modifications you want. Use `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+H` and simply replace `addons/components/ui` with `addons/cluster/reliverse/shadcn/ui` (the difference is only in the words "browser" and "cluster"). `addons/cluster` is your house; feel free to do anything you want here, mess it up or tidy it up as you wish. This is your own house, and no one has the right to take it away from you.
