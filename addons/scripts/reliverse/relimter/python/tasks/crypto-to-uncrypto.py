# üêû Not finished. Please make commit before usage. This is a script that searches for the presence of `throw new Error` and replaces it with `throw new Error`. The script also adds the `import { BaseError } from "~/core/error";` if it is missing.

# Usage:
# py addons\reliverse\relimter\python\tasks\crypto-to-uncrypto.py

# After using this script, you may or not may need to run the following scripts:
# 1. If needed, find and remove duplicate imports (TODO: implement this script)
# 2. pnpm appts

directories = ["addons", "src"]

# File encoding

# The import statement for uncrypto
crypto_import = 'import { subtle } from "uncrypto";\n'

# Counters for reporting
total_replacements = 0
total_files_modified = 0
