# Script to search for deprecated ESLint plugin rules
# Created by Nazar Kornienko https://github.com/blefnk

# To use - install Python and run - `py eslint.dep.py`

# TODO: Match both quoted and unquoted rules in config
# TODO: Currently only quoted properties are triggered
# TODO: "semi": "off" works, but semi: "off" - doesn't
