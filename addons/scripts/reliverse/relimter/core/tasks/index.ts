// Codemods are transformations that run on your codebase programmatically.
// This allows a large number of changes to be programmatically
// applied without having to manually go through every file.
// Reliverse and Next.js provide Codemod transformations to help upgrade your Next.js codebase when an API is updated
// or deprecated. To use @next/codemod @see https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods
// To use @reliverse/addons-relimter just run `pnpm fix:codemod-next-community` and make your choice.
// But we're recommending to commit your changes before running any of the codemod.
// ! USE AT OWN RISK ! IT IS NOT FINISHED YET AND NOT TESTED TOO MUCH !
