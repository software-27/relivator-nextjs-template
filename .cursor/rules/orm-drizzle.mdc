# How to Work with Drizzle ORM (AI Rules)

## Debugging: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'referencedTable')`

This error happens when Drizzle can't find relationship metadata for a relational query (e.g., `db.query.someTable.findMany({ with: { relatedTable: true } })`).

**Checklist:**

1.  **Missing `relations` Definition:**  
    *   Define a `relations` object for the source table (e.g., `userRelations = relations(userTable, ({ many }) => ({ uploads: many(uploadsTable) }))`).  
    *   `.references()` only sets up the DB foreign key; it doesn't create Drizzle's relation for queries.
2.  **Relations Not Exported:**  
    *   Export all `relations` objects from schema files.  
    *   Ensure your schema barrel file (e.g., `src/db/schema/index.ts`) exports all tables and relations.
3.  **Wrong Schema Passed to Drizzle:**  
    *   When initializing, pass a schema object with both tables and relations:  
        `import * as schema from './schema';`  
        `const db = drizzle(conn, { schema });`
4.  **Build Issues:**  
    *   In monorepos or complex setups, make sure all schema/relation files are included in the build.
5.  **Multiple Drizzle Instances:**  
    *   Use a single shared Drizzle client (e.g., export `db` from `src/db/index.ts`).
