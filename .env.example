# || ðŸ”¥ [Important note]: Please note that currently, v1.2.6 requires specifying Clerk, as its API has changed.
# || We are working on making Clerk optional again. However, all other environment variables are optional.
# || If this statement is incorrect, meaning something is broken somewhere, please let us know.

# ====================================================
# GENERAL
# ====================================================

# || You can try our brand-new linting script: `pnpm lint:env` or `pnpm appts:env`.
# || These commands will check the correctness of your .env and .env.example files.

# Specify the website domain in production
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# ====================================================
# DATABASE
# ====================================================

# || When the following connection string is set, you can run "pnpm db:push" to create/update the database tables.
# || If you've just created the database, please give your provider a moment for the database to be fully created.

# Database (https://neon.tech) (it's recommended to check 'Pooled connection' to get the production URL)
DATABASE_URL=""

# || DATABASE URL EXAMPLES (pg: try 'postgresql://' if 'postgres://' does not work)
